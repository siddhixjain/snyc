<table class="center" style="width:75%"><tr><td><center><p style="color:blue">Now you know how it matters, you are probably thinking, But what can we do? Well, that is no longer an excuse. There are many things you could do, and some of them you may have heard, and some might sound completely insane, but please try. One thing, simply is to not kill animals. Not animals like lions, but even the small ones in your community, such as snails, worms, ants, and birds. You should also stop plucking. If you want to do more, you can tell others,too! You can put up posters, and even start your own club like ours! But this is only one thing you can do. This idea might sound gross, but you can try it. Get a plastic bottle, and, with the help of an adult, place it in the toilet tank, away from any moving parts. Now the bottle will be taking space up in your tank and not water, and you can save at least a gallon every day! Soon your parents water bill will be cut in half! Plus, as you saw, don't litter. Keep it in a bag to throw in the first trash can you see. And that brings me to the four Rs; Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Repeat! First, reduce the amount of trash you make anyway. Don't use a trillion cups at a party, just keep refilling the same one! Then, Reuse! Don't throw it, take it home. Decorate it and use it as a piggy bank. Next, recycle. Time has come, and now I can't use it anymore. Throw it. Not in the trash can! In the blue recycling bin where it will be made into a new cup! The things you can recycle are paper, carboard, plastic, glass, and metal! The last thing is to repeat. Start all over again! Now I will be telling you six reusing tips. <br><br><h4 style="color: purple">Number 1:</h4><h7 style="color:Navy">Empty lip balm containers can be used as a hiding place for roled up money.<br><br><h4 style="color: purple">Number 2:</h4>Plastic eggs can be used to stash jewlery. <br><br><h4 style="color: purple"> Number 3:</h4> Wrap your sanwiches in cloth, instead of in a plastic bag. Bonus: it doubles as a napkin!<br><br><h4 style="color: purple">Number 4:</h4>Sunglasses double as smartphone stands to watch a movie or video.<br><br><h4 style="color: purple">Number 5:</h4>Keep shoes inside a shower cap to keep them away from other clother. Just remember to wash them before using! <br><br><h4 style="color: purple">Number 6</h4>Plastic bottles can be used as piggie banks. Turn the cup on it's side, so it can be rolled. Cut 4 stips of paper with a long lenghth but a short, maybe 1 inch width. Roll them along the shorter side, so that you get 4 short rolls. glue them to the bottom of the bottle, 2 on each side, maybe around 70ยบ apart. Stand the bottle so they are like legs. Cut a slit on the top. Now, paint! Make the lid part a head, and make whatever animal you want!</p></center></td></tr>
