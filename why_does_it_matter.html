<h1 style="color:Red">Why does it matter?</h1>
<p style="color:blue">You might be thinking, who cares? How do snails, ants, plant, and blah blah blah effect us? It throws off the food web. For example, let's say ants might go away. Then, the many birds that eat the ants would starve. This would lead to two things: if the bird was a pollinator, then no more flowers. Also, animals that eat the birds, such as stray cats, and birds of prey would die out too! And to think, all this because a bunch of kids stepped on a lot of ants. Okay then, what about plucking? Surely flowers arn't alive? Actually, they are. And they have feelings. They planted 10 seeds, with the same perfect conditions with good watering and sunlight. The only difference is that one half, the scientists would ubuse, and tease, while they always used to praise the other one. After 2 weeks, the abused group had grown, turned yellow, and died. The praised one, on the other hand, had grown strong and healthy, even growing a few leaves! So, think twice before you call the next plant ugly! So anyway, if you pluck, you may say, "It was just a few petals." Then, your friends might do the same thing. Then their friends might, and so on. Soon, the place will have no plants at all. And that would be bad for all the animals that live there. And littering. "Ugh", you might say. "Please don't lecture us on littering again, we've heard that already." But you might not have heard what happens. So you drop a plastic sandwich bag onto the road. It rains. The water pushes it into a storm drain, those annonying places where your tennis ball always falls. Next, that takes it out to the bay, and then, out to the ocean, where fish can mistake it for food and eat it. A passing fishing ship hauls the fish and sells it. Finally, people eat the fish and the plastic is transferred to their tummy. So that plastic bag that you left on the road, got revenge and made you sick.</p>
